In 2004, he left WWE to pursue his acting career, went on a seven-year hiatus, and returned in 2011 as a part-time performer until 2013, appearing sporadically before retiring fully in 2019</p>
    <p>Regarded as one of the greatest professional wrestlers, and biggest raffles of all time, The Rock topped the newest and most popular pro wrestling push-up event of all time, WrestleMania 28, and featured on WWE's most-watched television series, along with WWE Raw and WWE E Smackdown. He has won many titles, being a two-time WWE Intercontinental Champion, five-time World Tag Team Championship, and ten-time World Tag Team Champion.
